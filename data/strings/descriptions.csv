#YWY SHIPS,,,,,,
ywy_teufu-ji_ffgd_base,SHIP,"""It,"" the project lead slammed his fist on the table, teeth bared and gritted for the rest of the company staff to see, ""was never meant to be on a battlefield. For the Gates' sake, its a damn testbed, an experiment! What the hell did you expect when it had to go up against a Tri-Tach taskforce? This isn't a bloody cartoon where the prototypes win the day, instead we just gave the bluesuits some of the Yards' own trade secrets.""

The rest of the company staff did not say anything against the project lead's rant. He was right, of course. While the experimental drone frigate was designed as a warship, it was meant to be deployed in a controlled and simulated environment - a way to test and troubleshoot experimental weapons and tools before the next stage. All of which were now lost to the void and potentially in Tri-Tachyon hands, as for reasons unknown, the project's sole experimental frigate was deployed alongside some backwater Hegemony militia fleet against a Tri-Tachyon drone taskforce. A deployment that resulted in a crushing defeat for the militia fleet, wiped to last ship alongside the experimental frigate.

Ironically, unbeknownst to the Yards and Tri-Tachyon, the experimental frigate survived the battle and fled from Tri-Tachyon forces. Against all odds, it would escape but without enough fuel to return back to friendly territory, it would be stranded in a system long after the AI wars had came and went... until the remnants of the first war found it in hibernation. Waste not, want not as the old adage went.",,,,
ywy_lohenli_dd_base,SHIP,"One of Yoshgramm-wen's first produced designs and widely popular, the Lohen-li was designed to be a low cost, easily assembled, and capable workhorse vessel for low income buyers. Intended to operate in groups of itself or with similar ships, the Lohen-li are to be used as a literal line of guns in a battle - hence its official designation as a ""line destroyer."" Characteristic of this ""wall of guns"" belief that Yoshgramm-wen subscribes to, the Lohen-li mounts a spinal weapon along its length - a Metal Storm Launching System - and forward facing missile hardpoints.

Said to be the first design to be drawned up in the infancy of Yoshgramm-wen Yards, the Lohen-li's release on the pre-Collapse market was what propelled the Yards into renown and popularity. Its low price, easy nanoforge-optional assembly, and overall performance were (and still are) attractive points that saw the ship proliferate the Domain's frontiers. Used extensively by Domain patrol groups as effective gap fillers and by independent groups as screening vessels, the Lohen-li serves admirably well in its role as a ""line destroyer.""",,,,
ywy_wuhauser_cve_base,SHIP,"The first carrier design of Yoshgramm-wen Yards, the Wuhauser was similiarly designed like the Lohen-li to be a cost-effective and easily assembled vessel for low income clients. Out of the all of the components of the vessel, the arguably most expensive would be the unique ECM systems built into the stylish ""wings"" that protrude from the Wuhauser's rear. While not exactly designed to be used en-masse like the Lohen-li, the Wuhauser offers an effective escort carrier choice for merchant and frontier fleets - helped by Yoshgramm-wen's fine-tuned engines that aim for fuel efficiency and travel range.

Following the Lohen-li-class's success, Yoshgramm-wen Yards drew up the Wuhauser-class escort carrier as a companion ship and to bank on their earned renown. While slightly pricier due to the built-in ECM systems, the same attributes that made the Lohen-li popular applied the same to the Wu-hauser. Though never sighted in significant numbers, the allure of an affordable and effective carrier meant that it was a common sight to see a Wuhauser alongside another or with a Condor in Domian patrols and independent frontier fleets.",,,,
ywy_lichterbo_cv_base,SHIP,"A departure from the boxy rectangle designs, the Lichter-bo was designed to be a step above the Wuhauser-class escort carrier. While not comparably easy to assemble and significantly more expensive, the design has the capacity for four strikecraft wings, a temporary fifth wing, and the ability to enter and enact operations in planetary atmospheres. Marketed as a fleet carrier, the Licther-bo offers not only a choice command vessel but a major support tool for ground operations for those that need it. With its Electronic Warfare Suite supporting its four wings, the carrier also proves to be an cost-effective substitute for an Astral-class capital carrier.

To follow up the Wuhauser-class's success, designers and engineers at Yoshgramm-wen Yards set off to develop a larger carrier that would expand on the capabilites of the Wuhauser-class while still catering to their low-income clients. What resulted was significantly more than an enlarged Wuhauser-class. Doubled wing capacity, an active electronic warfare weapon, and the capacity for fleet command elevated the Lichter-bo-class as a choice fleet leader for militia and independent fleets. But the Yards's would specifically champion the carrier's most prominent feature as its primary selling point.

The Lichter-bo-class carrier's resemblance to bluewater hulls was an intentional choice by the Yards, to facilitate cost-cutting measures and atmospheric entry and exit. The catapult systems on all three decks - viewed as redunant in the void of space - would allow the carrier to launch strikecraft in the atmosphere. While not necessarily a major draw, the ability to support ground operations appealed greatly to buyers, especially with militia fleets that often fended off pirate raids and Domain units that raided rebel and pirate holds.",,,,
ywy_luohoff_ca_base,SHIP,"As a companion ship to the Lichter-bo-class fleet carrier, the Luohoff can fulfill multiple roles in a fleet - carrier escort, wolfpack anchor, offensive spearhead. Easily the most expensive product in Yoshgramm-wen Yard's catalogue, the Luohoff-class boasts a powerful potential with its array of mounts and - as expected of the Yards's subscription to the ""wall of guns"" vision of space warfare - a battery of powerful beam projectors on the bow. While not as comprehensively focused like the Aurora-class or the Dominator-class, the weapon mount layout of the Luohoff allows a degree of versatility in a client's choice of armament and role for the heavy cruiser.

A curiously aquatic-inspired design, the Luohoff was a logical creation as the Yards needed a balanced heavy hitter to round out their catalogue. While not as popular as the affordable Lohen-li-class and Wuhauser-class, or the versatile Lichter-bo-class, the Luohoff stands at a respectable level of weapons and armor compared to other cruisers of its size. For frontier fleets strapped for money - frequent customers for Yoshgramm-wen Yards - the Luohoff's relatively heavy and flexible armament potential was worth its weight in its price tag.",,,,
,,,,,,
ywy_fightbomb_craft,SHIP,"Designed to be a slightly costlier but effective alternative for the Broadsword, the Type 157 Vonlubu strikecraft addresses the lack of killing power against larger vessels with a payload of over-the-wing mounted missiles and a pair of energy vulcans on the nose.

Revealed and released to the public market alongside the Lichter-bo-class fleet carrier, the Vonlubu strikecraft was Yoshgramm-wen Yards's answer to the ubiquitous Broadsword. While higher in price and weight, the use of energy weapons and the addition of high-explosive missiles give the Vonlubu a considerable step up in firepower over the Broadsword and a degree of strategic flexibility. Additionally, because the strikecraft was designed and released alongside the exoatmospheric Lichter-bo-class fleet carrier, its aeronautical frame allows for smooth operation in planetary atmosphere.",,,,
ywy_fightbomb_SUPERcraft,SHIP,"Equipped with the Special Arsenal Upgrade Package [SAUP] and modified to handle it, the Type 157-S Vonlubu - popularly known as the 'Super Vonlubu' - features a heavier set of armaments that allows it to punch targets beyond its hull size, and a pinpoint omni shield for better survivability. However, the this comes at the cost of agility, armor, and structural integrity due to the package's added bulk and power requirements.

While the base Vonlubu fighter is serviceable as a Broadsword alternative, there were those that believed it could be better. To avoid obsolescence against other models from the Yards, and to make the Vonlubu more appealing, the Special Arsenal Upgrade Package, or SAUP, was devised. While the package requires that removal of the CES and the ESPV from the base model, the installment of a heavier Energy Storm weapon, a rack of anti-ship MIRVs, and wing-mounted micromissile pods makes it a worthy tradeoff. With the loss of the CES and added mass, however, even with the SAUP's added engines the Super Vonlubu noticeably lacks the agility of the base model; though it is considerably faster thanks to the added engines.",,,,
ywy_heavyinter_craft,SHIP,"A multirole aerospace asset designed primarily for ground attack, the Type-327 Xuoffen is a highly flexible asset on a strategic and tactical scale compared to the Vonlubu. Its wing hardpoints allow it to carry a multitude of loadouts, although operations in the void normally have the Xuoffen kitted as an interceptor with Metal Storm and flak pods.

With the success of the Type 157 Vonlubu, Yoshgramm-wen Yards would further exploit the market for aerospace strikecraft with the Type-327 Xuoffen. A twin engine configuration balances the need for speed with the ability to carry an impressive array of equipment under the wings, including missile pods to 4-ton bombs designed to bust bunkers. While the Xuoffen is an impressive (albeit fragile) weapons platform for an interceptor, its truly shines as a ground attack craft where its ability to ferry heavy munitions is a blessing for ground pounders facing armor or fortified positions.",,,,
ywy_heavyinter_SUPERcraft,SHIP,"Owing to its nature as a multirole strikecraft, the Xuoffen can don a set of equipment that turns it into a dual AWACS-EWAR support craft, officially named the Seheryuan. Geared with EWAR equipment, a sensor and communication mast, and seeker flare pods, the Seheryuan provides multitude of benefits for allied ships and fighters around it.

The Seheryuan came into being as a cost-effective support asset for fleets that lack those assets, coming not only with active EWAR pods but the ability to boost allied ships' weapon range and augment their point defense network; in addition to providing early warning and target analysis for strikecraft assets, improving survival rates significantly. However, because of the support equipment, the Seheryuan only has the ESPS as the sole weapon to defend itself and allies.",,,,
ywy_dronebomber_craft,SHIP,"""An unmanned and autonomous vehicle that strikes like the lightning of Jangala's storms,"" said the spokesperson. ""Rapidly fleeting yet no less deadly.""

The assembly of Domain Navy and Explorarium staff applauded at the conclusion of the sales pitch. Behind the spokeperson sat the subject of the speech - a sleek and sharp-looking aerospace jet, its long thin wings swept back like a diving bird of prey. 

Truly autonomous combat vehicles, the ones that operate independently of human oversight, were illegal under Domain law; a stance taken to asasuge fears and to endorse an ethical practice of warfare. In the frontier, however, where enforcement of such laws were loose and independence ran rampant, combat drones emblazoned with the Explorarium's insignia would quietly bolster frontier Domain fleets and crackdown on rebellions. Like other companies in the Military-Industrial Complex, Yoshgramm-wen Yards were eager to capitalize on the Domain's need for drones from small to big.",,,,
ywy_dronebomber_SUPERcraft,SHIP,"""These things aren't particularly smart despite their independence,"" the Yard engineer rapped their knuckles against the frame. ""Its why we call the ones that carry the nukes Lichming-nahuo - sure those fission nukes aren't as bad as anitmatter but its not something to mass produce and fling around like candy.""

When humanity was still bound to old Earth, nuclear weapons were feared as tools of mass destruction - the means to end mankind in its cradle. Nowadays, with the advent of space travel, antimatter, and advanced weapons development had succeeded nuclear weapons with significantly more dangerous armaments. In spite of their obsolence, some view nuclear weapons as a cost-effective measure of obtaining relatively powerful munitions. 

The Yards took this step further and have mass produced nuclear missiles to be equipped on their independent drone bombers.",,,,
ywy_superfighter_craft,SHIP,"""Now, let me make this clear Jimm. We, the Yoshgramm-wen Yards, must reaffirm and reassure people that we aren't producing combat drones and giving them Beta-level intelligence,"" the Yard representative reached for the cup of water on the table, his throat not parched. ""Besides, you'd know what the Domain would do if that was the case - or those Luddic people too. We might be apart of the MIC but we know there's some lines to never cross.""

The technician tuned out the broadcast of the talk show - someone had turned on the media screen at some point as background noise. As fun as it is to watch Jimm 'N Talk, it was not conductive to testing a prototype production model of a high-tech UCAV crammed with a Beta equivalent core. He and the others watched the nanoforge assemble the first model from the inserted LPC, the corresponding kill switch to either the forge or drone ready to be activated. The supervising security and observing technicans and engineers tensed as the forge lowered the now completed drone, the wide flying wing almost too big for the platform. Power was supplied and the cockpit glowed with a intense orange as the core booted up.

Before anyone could speak, the light flickered as the drone core boomed with the integrated speakers. ""This unit acknowledges its operators. This unit affirms all systems green. This unit is ready to sortie.""",,,,

#MSLS Modes,,,,,,
ywy_MSLS_low,WEAPON,"Metal Storm Launching System. A spinal-mounted weapon system that rapidly fires tubes of superposed ammunition via electric primers. Fires large bursts with lengthy downtime in between. This ship's MSLS is currently set to low RPM mode, allowing sustainable but smaller salvos.

An old weapon concept that dates back to early spaceflight Humanity, it utilizes tubes of superposed ammunition with electronic primers to ignite the propellents. Simple, flexible, and effective, the Metal Storm concept saw revitalization by numerous entities across history. Of all of them, the Yoshgramm-wen Yards are the most renowned and popular users of the Metal Storm system, thanks to their Lohen-li-class Destroyers that mount their derivative design. Thanks to the electronic primer system, the MSLS can scale its fire rate from absurdly low to absurdly high levels, at the cost of flux generation and longer downtime between salvos. ",,,,
ywy_MSLS_med,WEAPON,"Metal Storm Launching System. A spinal-mounted weapon system that rapidly fires tubes of superposed ammunition via electric primers.

#Kill Rods,,,,,,
ywy_GKKR,WEAPON,"Guided Kinetic Kill Rod Launcher. A prow-mounted angled launch system, fires a heatseeking missile propelled by a powerful engine. High speed but poor tracking due to insufficient compensation from the guidance system.

Nothing more than a solid metal tube attached to a solid fuel engine with a gimbal-mounted thruster, the GKKRL is built to be an economical anti-shield weapon for designs strapped for space and power. The launcher is fed by an autoloader system linked to an autoforge hardcoded to manufacture the kill rods, a process that takes only a few seconds. While effective in sustaining a barrage, the overwhelmingly strong thrust produced by the engines provides difficulty for the guidance system to adjust - not helped by the singular gimbal-mounted thruster - the missile's trajectory; it isn't uncommon to equate an overshot with a miss.",,,,
,,,,,,
#Electronic Warfare,,,,,,
ywy_EWS,WEAPON,"Electronic Warfare Suite. Targets an enemy ship with a communication laser to force a link between the target and the EWS. A combination of garbage data and malicious software delivered over this forced connection can disrupt ship operations on the target, so as long the high-powered comm laser is kept focused on the target.

An attempt at a more active electronic warfare, Yoshgramm-wen Yards's EWS origins are quite humorous if the records are correct. Supposedly, the inclusion of the suite was an afterthought suggestion made by an enginner, days after the first of the Lichter-bo-class was unveiled to the public. While made as a jest, coincidentally the sensors and communications array on the left flank of the Lichter-bo-class had enough space to house more components, and the afterthought suggestion would later be fully realized and implemented into the Lichter-bo-class carriers. In spite of its rushed and late integration into the design, the Yards's EWS proved to be a popular weapon among strikecraft wings for improving survival rates.",,,,
,,,,,,
#PPCs,,,,,,
ywy_ASPBP,WEAPON,"Anti-Ship Particle Beam. Distinctive signature weapon of the Luohoff-class heavy cruiser, generates an immense rate of hard flux in exchange for a trio of charged particle beams strong enough to cut through capital ship armor. Requires a long recovery period after firing and, if necessary, flux venting.

To solidify the Luohoff-class cruiser's role as the key element in a battle line, Yoshgramm-wen Yards developed a high-powered particle beam projector dervied from various mining laser models, and enlarging it before mounting the three of them onto the Luohoff-class's bow. Initial testing showed performance that outstripped the Phase Lance, though later iterations scaled back the destructive power due to the insane amount of hard flux generated - enough that it required the initial prototype to be directly hooked into the testing facility's power plant to be feasibly fired. To compromise between sustainability and stopping power, the Luohoff-class was given three of the final iteration models, enough to let it punch up against capital ships.",,,,
ywy_PPBP,WEAPON,"eXperimental Pulse Particle Beam. An attempt to follow up on the Shipbreaker ASPBP mounted on the Luohoff-class, the Drillbit XPPBP was a test on the feasibility of a ""rapid-fire"" anti-ship particle projector. While initially successful, the concept proved to be highly flux-expensive to fire, not to mention the requirement of a powerful powerplant. Thus, the issues were to solved through a series of controlled field tests which were ultimately never completed.",,,,
,,,,,,
#Modular Weps,,,,,,
ywy_HEPBP,WEAPON,"High-Energy Particle Beam. Dual-barrled beam weapon supercharged for high damage and range. High rate of flux generation and slight reduction to turret rotation speed due to bulk, but seamlessly can transition between point defense and ship-to-ship combat when needed.",,,,
ywy_MSPDS,WEAPON,"Metal Storm Point Defense System. A point defense system loaded with racks of superposed ammunition ignited by electronic primers. Quickly cycles through magazines of high explosive rounds, in exchange for considerable flux per second and comparably slow turret rotation speed.",,,,
ywy_XPDCG,WEAPON,"eXperimental Point Defense Canister Gun. A ballistic weapon loaded with 'smart' canister shots, programmed to release a hail of pellets when an enemy is found within the canister's front arc. Owing to being an experimental model, however, the canisters remain unreliable and may fail to burst against targets like missiles.",,,,
ywy_GKKR_single,WEAPON,"Guided Kinetic Kill Rod. A standalone version of the Wuhauser's built-in weapon system, without the attached autoforge. Max magazine capacity of three kill rods, fired one at a time. Best used in numbers or used sparingly in times of opportunity.",,,,
ywy_CIMP,WEAPON,"Close-In Missile Platform. The Yards' alternative to the Swarmer SRM launcher, the CIMP fires a large volley of micro-missiles at incoming strikecraft. While short-lived, these micro-missiles have potent tracking, fairly strong warheads, and can inflict substantial EMP damage on smallcraft targets.",,,,
ywy_EMPAC,WEAPON,"Energy Model Plasma Auto Cannon. Based off the Hephaestus Assault Gun, the EMPAC doesn't use the superposed ammo concept and instead conventionally loads and electronically fires the plasma cartridges through an electromagnetic coil. However, the model suffers from heat retention in the barrel and coils, leading to a drop in accuracy over time.",,,,
ywy_GKKR_pod,WEAPON,"Guided Kinetic Kill Rod. A larger standalone version of the Wuhauser's built-in weapon system - although sizeable, the pod lacks the attached autoforge. Comes with a magazine loaded with a total of 24 kill rods with a loose rate of fire. Useful for overwhelming enemy PDs or eviscerating engine bays of vulnerable vessels.",,,,
ywy_SRSMB,WEAPON,"Short-Ranged Sabot Missile. A sextuplet of SRMs with APFSDS warheads, fed by a autoloader system. Unlike other missile weapons, the SRSMB's magazine is linked to a highly compact but reliable autoforge - though the reloading process takes considerable time for each salvo replenishment.",,,,
ywy_SRASMB,WEAPON,"Short-Ranged Anti-Ship Missile. A quad arrangement of SRMs loaded with High Explosive Anti-Vessel warheads, utilizing a shaped charge jet to pierce through thick armor belts. Due to the cheap but short-lived solid fuel engines, the SRASMB's effective range is limited compared to other missile pods.",,,,
ywy_MSDCS,WEAPON,"Metal Storm Direct Combat System. A larger version of the MSPDS with a quadruplet arrangement, the MSDCS is designed for ship-to-ship combat - though it can adequately perform point defense if needed. Unsurprisingly, with more barrels and moving parts, the MSDCS is considerably slower to turn and intensely flux expensive to fire.",,,,
ywy_MSDCA,WEAPON,"Metal Storm Direct Combat Array. The logical end result of the the Yards' MS weapon systems, the MSDCA was not a popular product due to its extreme bulk, integrated safeties and governors that limit the weapon to burst fire mode, and limited engagement range. Still, if necessary, the MSDCA can fulfill the role of a close-in weapon very well.",,,,
ywy_MSDCA_Pmod,WEAPON,"Metal Storm Direct Combat Array, modified. While a unpopular weapon, certain parties (primarily pirates, Pathers, mercenaries) believed the weapon had potential. To achieve the believed potential, some MSDCA models would have their safeties and governors stripped and the weapon jury-rigged to rapidly cycle through its magazine. While potent in destruction, unsurprisingly these modified models run amok with flux and accuracy issues.",,,,
ywy_BMSAC,WEAPON,"Ballistic Model Shotshell Auto Cannon. One of Yoshgramm-wen's rare non-Metal Storm ballistic weapon, the BMSAC is essentially a large shotgun complete with equally large shotshells loaded with recycled metal ball bearings, sourced from shipbreaking yards. Intended to catch nimble smallcraft or place pressure on a gathering of enemy ships.",,,,
ywy_LRBMB,WEAPON,"Long-Range Bombardment Missile. Unlike the smaller Pilum missiles, the missiles launched by the LRBMB are bulkier and marginally faster. However, their second-stage payload has four bombs loaded with EMP equipment that - while slower than the Pilum's second stage and unguided - are tougher thanks to an armored casing.",,,,
ywy_XPLP,WEAPON,"eXperimental Phase Load Platform. With the advent of phase tech, a handful few sought to further exploit phase space. For the Yards, they succeeded with the refit of a phasecloaked drone, and attempted build on what they've learned. Thus, the XPLP - codename Trapdoor - was to further develop the concept of remote weapon reloading via phase technology. Unfortunately, this endeavor would be fruitless with the lost of the testbed frigate amidst the first AI war.",,,,
ywy_XPDP,WEAPON,"eXperimental Phase Deployment Platform. In conjunction with the Trapdoor XPLP, the XPDP - codenamed Dropbox - was another concept in the Yards' phase-tech experiment program. While the Trapdoor used phase coils to reload empty magazines, the XPDP used phase coils to directly deploy and launch munitions - something that could provide many benefits. Sadly, much like the XPLP, the sole prototype model would be lost on the testbed frigate in the first AI war.",,,,

ywy_SAUP_PAC,WEAPON,"Energy Storm Plasma Autocannon. Operates similarly to the ESPV with superposed cartridges of inert plasma ignited by electronic primers and guided by an electromagnetic coil. However, due to the bigger cartridges and the intense heat generated, disposable heat sink materials are packed alongside the plasma cartridges, which are then ejected when the weapon is fired.",,,,
ywy_SAUP_ASMR,WEAPON,"Anti-Ship Missile Rack. A rack loaded with two Anti-Ship MIRVs, the heaviest and most potent of the SAUP loadout. A notable feature of the MIRVs is the significant armor protection in the casing, allowing the MIRVs to survive most point defense fields before deploying their payload.",,,,
ywy_SAUP_MSMMP_l,WEAPON,"Metal Storm Micro Missile Pod. Much like all other Metal and Energy Storm weapons, the micro-missiles in these pods are tightly packed and superposed against each other.

For bombing runs against enemy ships, the 4-ton General Purpose Explosive Ordinance (GPEO) is commonly equipped. A capable and armored bunker buster for air-to-ground operations, the MPEO is more than capable of stripping chunks of ship armor.",,,,
ywy_dronebomber_nuke,WEAPON,"Nuclear Fission Guided Ordinance. While nuclear weapons had since lost their feared reputation in this day and age, their destructive capability cannot be understated. Even in the void of space, a direct and point-blank detonation of a nuclear explosion against a ship would result in complete vaporization of the area of contact and impulsive shock across the vessel. Yoshgramm-wen Yards had seen fit to exploit this detail and mass produce high-yield nuclear missiles for use by their aerospace drone bombers.",,,,
,,,,,,
ywy_dronefighter_gun,WEAPON,"Metal Storm Vulcan. Internally mounted in the Yuzhanji strikecraft - with a total of six pods - the weapons occupy the same weapon ports as the flak autocannons. Derived from the MSGPs frequently mounted on the Xuoffen, the MSVPs used a heavier load in conjunction with a higher rate of fire. To offset the recoil and flux generated by the array of six MSVPs being fired, the weapons are partioned into their own fire group to be switched on and off by the drone.",,,,
ywy_dronefighter_flakgun,WEAPON,"Metal Storm Flak Cannon. Internally mounted in the Yuzhanji strike - to a total of six guns - the weapons are housed in the same ports as the MSVPs. Based on the BMFGPs mounted on the Xuoffen, the MSFC applies the Metal Storm system to increase the rate of fire of the weapon, and by extension its lethality. Like the MSVP, the weapons are partioned to their own firing group to mitigate the recoil and flux generation.",,,,
ywy_dronefighter_mslpod,WEAPON,"Metal Storm Micro Missiles. An internal missile launcher that incorporates Metal Storm to rapidly fire 16 micro missiles - the same ones used on the CIMP and the Super Vonlubu - outfitted with a larger fuel load and smaller pure explosive warhead to increase flight time. While individually weak and easily intercepted by area point defense, a swarm of micro missiles can wipe out wings of strikecraft and strip swaths of ship armor.",,,,
