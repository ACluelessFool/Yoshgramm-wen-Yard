***A lightweight StarSector ship pack that pays homage to sci-fi Japanese media.***

Drawing from the ship designs from the likes of the _Legend of the Galactic Heroes_, _Gundam_, _Space Battleship Yamato_ and a few others, this mod offers four ships accompanied by a slew of weapons and fighter wings.

New ships includes:
  - A destroyer class known as the _Lohen-li_, focused on a doctrine of holding established battle lines.
  - A small escort carrier class called the _Wuhauser_, a slow but reliable rear line asset.
  - The flexible and effective _Litcher-bo_-class fleet carrier, a ship capable of major force projection on the field.
  - And lastly, the imposing _Luohoff_-class heavy cruiser, armed with a strong potential with its slots and adaptive FCS.

New weapons feature:
  - Metal Storm weapon systems of all kinds.
  - An abundance of MIRVs and their submunitions.
  - A large ballistic shotgun.
  - And a handful of others.
